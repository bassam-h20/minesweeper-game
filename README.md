###### When the program is first run, the user is prompted to choose from one of 3 options for the size of the board

3. 10x10
* The user then enters the number of the row, then column, then 'F' or 'O' to either flag or open the cell as shown in the screenshot below
* Per Minesweeper rules, the cell selected by the user will display the amount of mines in a 1-cell proximity around it (in this case 1).
